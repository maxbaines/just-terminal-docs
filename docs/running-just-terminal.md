# Running and integrating JustTerminal

[← JustTerminal](../README.md)

Setup and reference material for running JustTerminal on your own machine or server.

## Build and run

The source repository is private. Building locally or deploying its Dockerfile requires collaborator access. This public documentation repository does not contain the application source or downloadable builds.

### Requirements

- A Unix-like Host: macOS, Linux, or WSL2
- Go 1.24.4 (the version pinned by `go.mod`)
- Node.js 22 and npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxbaines/just-terminal.git
cd just-terminal
make build
./bin/just-terminal
```

Running `just-terminal` without a subcommand starts the local Gateway at `http://127.0.0.1:8311` and opens it in your browser. Loopback access needs no authentication.

## Remote access

Put JustTerminal behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and give it the final public origin:

```bash
./bin/just-terminal serve \
  --addr 127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --behind-reverse-proxy \
  --public-origin https://terminal.example.com \
  --tunnel-origin 'https://{id}.apps.example.com'
```

Then create the single-use owner-enrollment link on the Host:

```bash
./bin/just-terminal auth init --origin https://terminal.example.com
```

Open the printed URL, register a passkey, enroll TOTP, and save the recovery codes. Passkeys are scoped to the configured hostname, so choose the final HTTPS origin before enrolling. The reverse proxy must forward both normal HTTP traffic and WebSocket upgrades.

See [Authentication](authentication.md) for setup, recovery, storage, and reset details.

## Docker and Coolify

The repository Dockerfile builds JustTerminal on top of the Codex universal image and includes Codex CLI, Claude Code, Playwright CLI with Chromium, zsh, GitHub CLI, Starship, delta, lazygit, and yazi. These JustTerminal-managed additions are grouped and versioned near the top of the final Docker stage, and each version can be overridden with a Docker `--build-arg`. The image listens on container port `8311`.
New terminal panes start in `/workspace` by default.

For a Coolify deployment:

1. Build from the repository `Dockerfile`.
2. Expose port `8311` through an HTTPS domain.
3. Set `JUST_TERMINAL_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to that exact origin (for example,
   `https://terminal.example.com`).
4. To expose local apps, route a wildcard hostname to the same container and set
   `JUST_TERMINAL_TUNNEL_ORIGIN` (for example,
   `https://{id}.apps.example.com`). See [Local app tunnels](local-app-tunnels.md).
5. Add persistent storage for the paths below.

| Destination | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/var/lib/just-terminal` | JustTerminal auth/config, shell history, Git/GitHub/npm settings, SSH/GnuPG state, and other XDG state |
| `/root/.codex` | Codex configuration, file-backed login, skills/plugins, and resumable sessions |
| `/root/.claude` | Claude Code configuration, login, and sessions |
| `/workspace` | Repositories and working files |

Do not persist `/run/just-terminal`; it contains runtime-only sockets. Treat the persisted volumes as sensitive because they can contain access tokens, private keys, and shell history.

### What persistence means

The Session Owner survives Remote Client disconnects and Gateway restarts, so live shells continue through a web-server restart or binary redeploy that leaves the Session Owner running.

A Host reboot, container replacement, or Session Owner stop still terminates live PTYs and their processes. Persistent volumes preserve files, configuration, resumable agent history, and the workspace names shown in the sidebar. Restored workspaces start with fresh panes; volumes cannot preserve a running shell process.

## Expose a local web app

Web apps running on the JustTerminal Host or inside its container can be reached through the existing JustTerminal URL. Start the app on a local port, for example:

```bash
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

Register that port with JustTerminal:

```bash
curl -sS \
  -X POST \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"port":5173}' \
  http://localhost:8311/api/tunnels
```

The response includes a short tunnel ID and a capability URL on the configured
wildcard origin:

```json
{"id":"a7k2q","port":5173,"url":"https://a7k2q.apps.example.com/_just-terminal/connect#token=…"}
```

Open the returned URL. The app receives its own hostname root, so ordinary
`/assets`, `/api`, cookies, redirects, and WebSockets work without application
changes. No additional container port needs to be published. Tunnel
registrations last until the JustTerminal Gateway restarts.

Wildcard DNS, TLS, and reverse-proxy routing must be configured once by the
operator. See [Local app tunnels](local-app-tunnels.md) for Caddy, Apache,
Traefik, and Coolify recipes.

## Agent integration with MCP

`just-terminal mcp` exposes a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server over JSON-RPC 2.0 on stdio. It connects to a running local JustTerminal instance and provides tools for:

- terminal input, command completion, and screen observation;
- Workspace and Pane lifecycle and layout;
- port-forward tunnel lifecycle; and
- live configuration reads and updates.

It also exposes current terminal screens as `pane://` resources.

### Amplifier

```bash
just-terminal amplifier install
```

### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add just-terminal -- just-terminal mcp
```

### OpenCode

Add this server to `opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "just-terminal": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["just-terminal", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `just-terminal <command> --help` for command-specific flags.

## How it works

```text
Remote Client (browser or installed PWA)
    ↕ WebSocket
Gateway (Go HTTP server, auth, configuration, file and tunnel APIs)
    ↕ Unix socket
Session Owner (Workspace registry, PTYs, VT buffers, replay)
    ↕ PTY
shells and coding agents
```

Each terminal Pane is backed by a real PTY. The Session Owner, not the browser, owns terminal state and answers terminal queries. The Gateway can therefore restart independently, and a reconnecting Remote Client receives a fresh serialization of the current VT cell grid plus retained scrollback.

Close controls are also Session Owner-authoritative. Idle Bash and Zsh panes close immediately; panes with running commands require confirmation. Codex/driver panes are treated as busy, while browser panes and panes whose activity cannot be inspected are treated as unknown and fail safe to confirmation.

The browser renders terminals with xterm.js and arranges Pane Groups with dockview. One WebSocket carries binary Pane I/O and JSON control messages between a Remote Client and the Gateway.

## Releases and updates

The repository includes a release workflow for checksummed Linux amd64 and macOS
amd64/arm64 archives. No releases are currently published on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/maxbaines/just-terminal/releases), so build
from source for now. The download installer depends on a published release;
the Homebrew tap is not yet published.

**About** contains update status and the native self-update controls. Container
deployments update by rebuilding or pulling and redeploying the image; the
in-app updater does not rewrite binaries in containers.

## Contributing

Build and run the isolated local development stack:

```bash
make build
make dev-local
```

Before committing, run the required static checks:

```bash
cd web && npm run check:fast
cd .. && go build ./...
```

JustTerminal does not accept new unit tests. Changes are verified against a real Gateway, Session Owner, shell, and browser. Start every verification pass with a fresh development runtime and a newly created Workspace and Pane, then exercise the behavior with `playwright-cli`:

```bash
playwright-cli open http://127.0.0.1:8313
playwright-cli snapshot
# interact with the real UI and inspect the result
playwright-cli close
```

Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) before contributing; it contains the full verification policy and fixture-hygiene requirements.
